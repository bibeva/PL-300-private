    <div class="question">
      <p>A manufacturing company uses Power BI dashboards to monitor production line metrics in real-time. Their data sources include factory sensors that stream data to an on-premises SQL database and a cloud-based data warehouse storing historical production data. <br>
To ensure that the dashboards always display the most up-to-date information from both data sources, which options should the company implement? <br>
(Select all that apply).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Scheduled refresh</li>
        <li>B. DirectQuery</li>
        <li>C. Dataflows</li>

    <div class="question">
      <p>A multinational corporation utilizes Power BI Service to distribute sales reports across its global offices. The IT department needs to ensure that only regional managers can view reports specific to their regions. What feature should be used to implement this requirement?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Row-level security (RLS)</li>
        <li>B. Workspace access control</li>
        <li>C. Publish to web</li>

        <li>D. Direct sharing</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Row-level security (RLS) restricts access to specific rows of data in a dataset based on the user’s role or identity. By configuring RLS, each regional manager can only see the sales data for their assigned region, ensuring data confidentiality while using the same report. Workspace access or direct sharing controls access to the entire report, not subsets of data, and “Publish to web” exposes the report publicly.</p>

    <h1>Question 244</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Your company tracks production data in real-time in a PostgreSQL database and stores summarized historical production data in an Excel file. To analyze both real-time and historical production trends, you decide to use Power BI's dual storage mode for the ProductionData table. <br>
Tables: <br>
- PostgreSQL Database (DirectQuery): <br>
Table Name: RealTimeProduction <br>
Columns: MachineID, Timestamp, UnitsProduced <br>
- Excel Spreadsheet (Imported): <br>
Table Name: HistoricalProduction <br>
Columns: Year, Month, MachineID, TotalUnitsProduced <br>
Question: In this scenario, applying dual storage mode to the ProductionData table allows you to:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Combine real-time production data with historical trends in the same report for comprehensive analysis.</li>
        <li>B. Import the entire PostgreSQL database into Power BI for faster report loading.</li>
        <li>C. Eliminate the need for the Excel spreadsheet by storing all data in PostgreSQL.</li>
        <li>D. Automatically update historical data in real-time within the Excel spreadsheet.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="active">A. Combine real-time production data with historical trends in the same report for comprehensive analysis.</li>
        <li>B. Import the entire PostgreSQL database into Power BI for faster report loading.</li>
        <li>C. Eliminate the need for the Excel spreadsheet by storing all data in PostgreSQL.</li>
        <li>D. Automatically update historical data in real-time within the Excel spreadsheet.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Using dual storage mode in Power BI allows a table to act as DirectQuery for real-time data and Import for historical data simultaneously. This enables reports to analyze current production metrics alongside historical trends without needing to fully import large real-time datasets. It does not import the entire database, eliminate the Excel file, or update static Excel data automatically.</p>

      <p>Your organization has monthly sales data in one table and daily inventory data in another. You need to analyze how monthly sales correlate with daily inventory levels. <br>
The sales table includes columns for Month, ProductID, and TotalSales, while the inventory table includes Date, ProductID, and InventoryLevel. <br>
Task: Describe the steps you would take in Power Query to prepare this data for analysis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Merge the sales and inventory tables on ProductID, then group by Month to summarize daily inventory levels.</li>
        <li>B. Create a custom column in the sales table to calculate average inventory levels, then merge with the inventory table on ProductID.</li>
        <li>C. Append the sales and inventory tables, then remove duplicates.</li>
        <li>D. Merge the tables on ProductID, ensuring the merge operation is configured to match on the closest date within each month.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="active">A. Merge the sales and inventory tables on ProductID, then group by Month to summarize daily inventory levels.</li>
        <li>B. Create a custom column in the sales table to calculate average inventory levels, then merge with the inventory table on ProductID.</li>
        <li>C. Append the sales and inventory tables, then remove duplicates.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To analyze the relationship between monthly sales and daily inventory, you first merge the tables using the common key, ProductID. Since the inventory data is daily, you then group by Month to aggregate inventory levels (e.g., average or total per month), aligning it with the monthly sales data. This ensures that the data is at the same granularity for meaningful analysis.</p>

      <p>A finance team needs to consolidate monthly expense reports from multiple departments. Each department's report is structured similarly with columns for Date, DepartmentID, ExpenseType, and Amount. <br>
The goal is to create a single, unified report in Power Query that includes a new column summarizing total expenses by department. <br>
Task: What steps would you recommend to achieve this in Power Query?
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Use the 'Remove Duplicates' function on the DepartmentID column after appending all reports.</li>
        <li>B. Merge each department's report into a single table using DepartmentID as a join key.</li>
        <li>C. Create a custom column in each department's report for cumulative expenses, then append all reports.</li>
        <li>D. Append all department reports into a single table, then group by DepartmentID to summarize expenses.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>A. Use the 'Remove Duplicates' function on the DepartmentID column after appending all reports.</li>
        <li>B. Merge each department's report into a single table using DepartmentID as a join key.</li>
        <li>C. Create a custom column in each department's report for cumulative expenses, then append all reports.</li>
        <li class="active">D. Append all department reports into a single table, then group by DepartmentID to summarize expenses.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Power Query, to consolidate reports, you first append all department tables into one unified table. Then, you group by the DepartmentID column and use an aggregation (e.g., sum of Amount) to calculate total expenses per department. This approach efficiently combines all data and provides the required summary without creating redundant or cumulative columns in individual reports.</p>

    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Delete one of the "CustomerID" columns.</li>
        <li>B. Rename one of the "CustomerID" columns to a different name.</li>
        <li>C. Change the data type of one of the "CustomerID" columns to match the other.</li>
        <li>D. Reverse the order of the tables in the merge operation.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Delete one of the "CustomerID" columns.</li>
        <li>B. Rename one of the "CustomerID" columns to a different name.</li>
        <li class="active">C. Change the data type of one of the "CustomerID" columns to match the other.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Power Query, columns used as keys for merging must have the same data type. Since one table has "CustomerID" as Text and the other as Whole Number, you should convert one column so that both match (either both Text or both Whole Number). This ensures a smooth merge without errors or mismatched rows.</p>
