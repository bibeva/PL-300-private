    <h1>Question 171</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a BI developer working for a software company. You're building a Power BI report to analyze customer usage data for a new mobile app.The data is stored in three separate Azure SQL databases: <br>
- Development Database: Used for testing new features and development work. <br>
- Test Database: Used for quality assurance and user acceptance testing. <br>
- Production Database: Contains the live production data used by the app. <br>
You want to create a single Power BI report (.pbix file) that can connect to any of these databases depending on the current development stage. You want to avoid using deployment pipelines to keep the solution simple and minimize administrative overhead. <br>
Challenge: How can you configure your Power BI report to dynamically switch between these databases without creating separate reports or using deployment pipelines? <br>
What type and how many parameters should you create in your Power BI report to achieve this dynamic data source switching?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Create three parameters of type Text.</li>
        <li>B. Create two parameters of type True/False.</li>
        <li>C. Create one parameter of type Text.</li>
        <li>D. Create one parameter of type Decimal Number.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Create three parameters of type Text.</li>
        <li>B. Create two parameters of type True/False.</li>
        <li class="active">C. Create one parameter of type Text.</li>
        <li>D. Create one parameter of type Decimal Number.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A single Text parameter can store the database name (or server/database combination). By changing this parameter value, the same PBIX can dynamically point to Development, Test, or Production without duplicating reports or using deployment pipelines.</p>

    <h1>Question 174</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst working for a large retail chain. You're analyzing sales data to understand overall performance and identify trends. However, you've noticed that some extreme values (outliers) are skewing your analysis and making it difficult to get a clear picture of typical sales patterns. You want to exclude these outliers from your calculations to get a more accurate representation of sales performance. <br>
Challenge: You need to create a DAX measure that calculates the total sales amount while excluding transactions that fall below the 5th percentile or above the 95th percentile of all sales values. This will allow you to focus on the core sales data and exclude any extreme values that might be distorting your analysis. <br>
Which DAX function should you use to identify and exclude these outlier sales transactions based on their percentiles?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. RANKX</li>
        <li>B. PERCENTILE.EXC</li>

        <li>D. TOP</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> PERCENTILE.INC is used in DAX to calculate percentile thresholds, such as the 5th and 95th percentiles, including boundary values. These calculated limits can then be applied in a FILTER expression to exclude extreme sales values and focus analysis on typical sales behavior.</p>

      <p>In your company's Power BI environment, you manage a dataset within a model that includes an "Employee Records" table. This table features the following attributes: <br>
Employee ID <br>
First Name <br>
Last Name <br>
Division <br> 
Earnings <br>
The unique identifier for each employee entry is the "Employee ID." Your task is to develop a DAX measure that computes the mean earnings for staff members who are part of the marketing division. Which DAX formula should you implement?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. DISTINCTCOUNT('Employee Records'[Earnings])</li>

    <h1>Question 176</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You're a data analyst for a popular online bookstore. You're tasked with creating a report to analyze customer purchase patterns. The data is stored in an Excel spreadsheet that contains details about each book purchased. You have a table named Book Purchases with the following columns: <br>
Purchase ID <br>
Customer ID <br>
Book Title <br>
ISBN <br>
Price   <br>
Quantity <br>
Customers can purchase multiple books in a single order, resulting in multiple rows with the same Customer ID in the table. You need to create a DAX measure to calculate the total number of unique customers who have made purchases. Which DAX formula should you use?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Count('Book Purchases'[Customer ID])</li>
        <li>B. CountA('Book Purchases'[Customer ID])</li>
        <li>C. CountRows('Book Purchases')</li>
        <li>D. DistinctCount('Book Purchases'[Customer ID])</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Count('Book Purchases'[Customer ID])</li>
        <li>B. CountA('Book Purchases'[Customer ID])</li>

        <li class="active">D. DistinctCount('Book Purchases'[Customer ID])</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Because a single customer can appear in multiple rows when they purchase more than one book, a simple COUNT or COUNTA would count transactions rather than customers. DISTINCTCOUNT evaluates the Customer ID column and returns the number of unique customers, which correctly represents how many individual customers have made at least one purchase.</p>

    <h1>Question 177</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are analyzing sales data in Power Query Editor for a retail management system. The dataset includes the following columns: <br>
- Tax Due <br>
- Order ID <br>
- Shipping Cost <br>
- Order Subtotal <br>
- Items per Order <br>
The "Order ID" column serves as a unique identifier for each sales transaction. The "Order Subtotal" and "Items per Order" columns always have data, but the "Tax Due" and "Shipping Cost" columns sometimes contain null values for transactions where no tax or shipping was charged.You aim to calculate monthly metrics including: <br>
- Average number of items per transaction  <br>
- Average shipping cost per transaction <br>
- Maximum number of items per transaction <br>
What modification should you make to the query to facilitate these calculations?
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Convert null values in the 'Items per Order' column to 0.</li>
        <li>B. Eliminate rows with null values in the 'Tax Due' column.</li>
        <li>C. Eliminate rows with null values in the 'Shipping Cost' column.</li>

        <li class="active">D. Convert null values in the 'Shipping Cost' column to 0.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To correctly calculate average shipping cost per transaction, nulls must be treated as zero where no shipping was charged. Removing rows would distort averages and counts, and Items per Order already has complete data. Converting null shipping values to 0 preserves all transactions and enables accurate monthly metrics.</p>

    <h1>Question 179</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst working for a library. You have two tables in an Azure SQL database: "Books" and "Loans." The "Books" table contains information about each book in the library, such as title, author, and ISBN. The "Loans" table records information about each book loan, including the borrower's name, loan date, and due date. Both tables are linked by a common column called "BookID." <br>
You're building a Power BI report to analyze book loan patterns and identify popular books. You need to combine the "Books" and "Loans" tables into a single table that includes all loan records and their associated book details. <br>
Challenge: How should you merge these tables in Power BI Desktop to achieve the following: <br>
- Include all loan records in the merged table, even if there's no matching book record. <br>
- For each loan record, include the corresponding book details if available. <br>
- Exclude any book records that have not been loaned out.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Merge the "Books" table into the "Loans" table using a left outer join based on "BookID."</li>
        <li>B. Append the "Books" table to the "Loans" table.</li>
        <li>C. Merge the "Loans" table into the "Books" table using an inner join based on "BookID."</li>
        <li>D. Create a relationship between the "Books" and "Loans" tables in the Power BI data model.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="active">A. Merge the "Books" table into the "Loans" table using a left outer join based on "BookID."</li>
        <li>B. Append the "Books" table to the "Loans" table.</li>
        <li>C. Merge the "Loans" table into the "Books" table using an inner join based on "BookID."</li>
        <li>D. Create a relationship between the "Books" and "Loans" tables in the Power BI data model.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Using a left outer join from Loans → Books ensures that all loan records are included, even if some loans reference books that might not exist in the "Books" table. The corresponding book details will be added where available. This approach excludes books that have never been loaned because the base table is "Loans," fulfilling the requirement to focus only on loaned books. Other options either exclude loans (inner join), combine unrelated data (append), or only create relationships without merging tables.</p>

    <h1>Question 180</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are developing a Power BI report for a real estate company that tracks property sales performance. The report includes a visual that displays the profit margin for each property sold. The profit margin is calculated using a DAX measure. <br>
The real estate agents have requested that the report adheres to specific formatting guidelines for clarity: <br>
- Profit margins must be displayed with two decimal places for consistency (e.g., 12.34%). <br>
- Negative profit margins, indicating a loss, must be displayed in red font with parentheses for easy identification (e.g., (5.67%)). <br>
What two actions should you perform in Power BI to meet these formatting requirements? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. For the visual, apply conditional formatting to the background color of the data points.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To display profit margins with two decimal places and format negative values with parentheses and red font, you should configure the DAX measure with a custom format string that specifies percentage formatting with two decimals and negative number style. Additionally, you should set "Value decimal places" to 2 in the visual’s formatting options to ensure the displayed values consistently show two decimal places. Conditional formatting for background or font size is not needed for this requirement.</p>
