    <h1>Question 191</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You have a dataset in Power BI Desktop containing information about projects. This dataset includes "Project Start Date" and "Project End Date" columns. You need to add a custom column called "Project Duration" that calculates the total number of days between these two dates for each project.
Which of the following M code snippets correctly calculates the "Project Duration" column?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "Project Duration", each Duration.Days([EndDate] - [StartDate]))</li>
        <li>B. Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "Project Duration", each [EndDate] - [StartDate])</li>
        <li>C. Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "Project Duration", Duration.Days([EndDate] - [StartDate]))</li>
        <li>D. Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "Project Duration", each [EndDate].DaysSince([StartDate]))</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="active">A. Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "Project Duration", each Duration.Days([EndDate] - [StartDate]))</li>
        <li>B. Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "Project Duration", each [EndDate] - [StartDate])</li>
        <li>C. Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "Project Duration", Duration.Days([EndDate] - [StartDate]))</li>
        <li>D. Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "Project Duration", each [EndDate].DaysSince([StartDate]))</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Subtracting two date values in Power Query returns a duration. The Duration.Days function converts that duration into a numeric value representing total days. The each keyword is required to apply the calculation row by row, making this the correct and complete M code solution.</p>

    <h1>Question 193</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are developing a Power BI report to display company-confidential information from the "ConfidentialData" table. This table includes a column named "EmployeeEmail" which stores the email address of each employee in the organization. <br>
To ensure data security, you need to restrict access so that employees can only see data rows associated with their own email address. How can you achieve this row-level security (RLS) in your Power BI report? <br>
Select all that apply.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Create a role in Power BI Desktop and define a DAX expression that filters the "ConfidentialData" table based on the "EmployeeEmail" column and the USERPRINCIPALNAME() function.</li>
        <li>B. Publish the report to the Power BI service and configure row-level security in the dataset settings, then provide workspace-level access to each employee</li>
        <li>C. Share the report with individual employees, granting them Viewer access.</li>
        <li>D. Add a calculated column to the "ConfidentialData" table that compares "EmployeeEmail" with the current user's email address.</li>

    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Dynamic RLS is implemented by creating roles in Power BI Desktop using DAX that compares EmployeeEmail with the logged-in user. Sharing reports or workspace access alone does not enforce row-level filtering, and calculated columns cannot detect the current user.</p>

      <p>To calculate the year-to-date total of sales in a DAX formula, you should use the __________ function wrapped around the SUM of the SalesAmount column, specifying a date column within the same table.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Excel Online connector (allows Power BI to connect directly to an Excel file stored in OneDrive for Business, supporting automatic refresh. The SharePoint Folder connector also works because OneDrive for Business is backed by SharePoint, enabling scheduled refresh of files stored there. Other connectors like Web, Data Lake Folder, or JSON do not reliably support automatic refresh for OneDrive-hosted Excel files.</p>

      <p>You are a business intelligence consultant working with "Contoso Retail", a large retail chain with stores across the country. Contoso Retail uses a SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) multidimensional cube hosted on their local network to analyze sales data. You have developed a Power BI report that connects to this SSAS cube to provide insights into sales trends, product performance, and regional analysis. <br>
You now need to publish this report to the Power BI service so that regional managers across the country can access it. However, it's crucial that these managers always see the most up-to-date sales figures from the on-premises SSAS cube when viewing the report in the Power BI service. What should you implement to ensure that the report in the Power BI service always reflects the latest data from the SSAS cube?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Configure an OData feed from the SSAS cube.</li>
        <li>B. Install and configure an on-premises data gateway.</li>
        <li>C. Set up a data refresh subscription for the report.</li>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To ensure that a Power BI report published to the service always accesses the latest data from an on-premises SSAS multidimensional cube, you must use an on-premises data gateway. This gateway securely connects Power BI Service to on-premises data sources in real time, enabling live connections or scheduled queries without moving the data to the cloud.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Cardinality determines the number of instances in one table that can relate to the number of instances in another table</li>
        <li>B. Many-to-many relationships allow for the direct analysis of measures across two tables without the need for a bridging table</li>
        <li>C. A one-to-one relationship is typically used when joining tables with unique keys that correspond to each other</li>
        <li>D. Cross-filter direction can be set to both to automatically filter both tables exclusively in a one-to-many relationship</li>
        <li>E. Single-directional cross-filtering is recommended to prevent ambiguity in filter context for related tables</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A is true because cardinality defines how rows in one table relate to rows in another. C is true since one-to-one relationships are used when both tables have unique matching keys. E is true because single-directional filtering is recommended to avoid ambiguous filter propagation. B is misleading, as many-to-many relationships often require careful modeling, and D is incorrect because bi-directional filtering should be used cautiously, not automatically.</p>
