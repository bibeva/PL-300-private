    <h1>Question 11</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>In overseeing a Power BI workspace, you're tasked with assigning the responsibility of configuring data refresh schedules to another user, adhering to the principle of least privilege. <br>
Which workspace role should be designated for this purpose?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Data Analyst</li>
        <li>B. Content Creator</li>
        <li>C. Report Consumer</li>
        <li>D. Contributor</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Data Analyst</li>
        <li>B. Content Creator</li>
        <li>C. Report Consumer</li>
        <li class="active">D. Contributor</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Contributor role allows users to add, edit, and configure content—including setting up data refresh schedules—without granting full administrative rights. This follows the principle of least privilege, giving only the necessary permissions to perform the task.</p>

    <h1>Question 12</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are a Power BI administrator responsible for managing data access and security for your organization's
        Power BI environment. You need to ensure that different departments (Sales, Marketing, Finance) can only access
        the data relevant to their operations, preventing them from viewing data from other departments. Which four
        actions should you perform in sequence to achieve this departmental data segregation? <br>
        1. Configure the app's access settings to include security group email addresses for each department. <br>
        2. Assign the "Contributor" role to all users in the Power BI service. <br>
        3. Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) on the datasets to restrict data access based on department. <br>
        4. Create a dedicated workspace for each department (Sales, Marketing, Finance). <br>
        5. Publish individual Power BI apps for each department, connecting to the relevant datasets.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. 4-3-5-1</li>
        <li>B. 5-3-1-2</li>
        <li>C. 1-5-3-4</li>
        <li>D. 2-5-3-1</li>
      </ul>

        <li>D. 2-5-3-1</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> First, create a dedicated workspace for each department. Next, implement Row-Level Security (RLS) on datasets to restrict data visibility. Then, publish individual apps for each department linked to their datasets. Finally, configure app access settings to include each department’s security group. This ensures secure, department-specific data access.</p>

    <h1>Question 13</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You have a Power BI report that analyzes customer purchase data. <br>
The report includes a matrix visual showing product categories and subcategories, along with their corresponding sales amounts. <br>
You want to allow users to filter the matrix visual to display data for only a specific product category. Which two visual elements can you use to achieve this? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. A slicer visual</li>
        <li>B. A drillthrough filter</li>
        <li>C. A table visual</li>
        <li>D. A card visual</li>

        <li>C. A table visual</li>
        <li>D. A card visual</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A slicer visual lets users interactively filter data in the matrix by selecting a specific product category. A drillthrough filter enables users to right-click on a category and navigate to a detailed report page showing only that category’s data. Table and card visuals display data but do not filter other visuals.</p>

    <h1>Question 14</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>In the process of designing a Power BI dashboard, you aim to implement a custom theme derived from an existing Power BI dashboard's theme. What format of file is required to accomplish this?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. TXT</li>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Power BI custom themes are defined using a JSON file format, which specifies colors, fonts, and visual styles. You can export a theme from an existing dashboard as a JSON file or import one to apply a consistent design across reports and dashboards.</p>

  <!-- <div class="questionFormat">
    <h1>Question 15</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Define whether the following statement is true or false: <br>
"In Power BI, when configuring a many-to-many relationship between two tables, the "Both" cross-filter direction is required to ensure proper filtering behavior."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. True</li>
        <li>B. False</li>

        <li class="active">B. False</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While “Both” cross-filter direction can help with filtering in some many-to-many scenarios, it is not required. Power BI handles many-to-many relationships using a relationship table (bridge) and can work with single-direction filters depending on the data model design. Using “Both” can sometimes cause ambiguity or circular filtering.</p>

      <p>CompanyC is a consultancy company focused on optimizing the supply chain for multinational manufacturing firms in Asia. CompanyC oversees a logistics solution that integrates several Azure SQL Server databases. <br>
Each manufacturing client is allocated a distinct database within an Azure subscription managed by CompanyC. The analytics team is tasked with developing a Power BI Desktop report to assess production efficiency across different clients. <br>
Due to varying analysis needs, each analyst is assigned to create a customized report for a specific client, necessitating access to unique databases. Does creating separate Power BI service workspaces directly facilitate the connection to specific Azure SQL Server databases for analysts using Power BI Desktop for report development?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. True</li>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Creating separate Power BI service workspaces does not control or facilitate database connections in Power BI Desktop. Connections to Azure SQL databases are configured directly within Power BI Desktop using connection strings and credentials. Workspaces manage content and permissions in the Power BI Service, not data source connectivity during report development.</p>

      <p>You have a Power BI report named "Sales Performance" that uses a custom color palette to maintain brand consistency. You want to create a new report, "Regional Analysis," with the same color scheme. <br>
You need to apply the custom color palette to "Regional Analysis" with the least amount of manual configuration. Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.</p>

      <p>When appending queries in Power Query, which of the following statements is true?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. The data types in corresponding columns must be identical</li>
        <li>B. The column names in the tables must be identical</li>
        <li>C. It combines rows from two queries, regardless of the column names</li>
        <li>D. It combines columns from two queries based on the column index</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. The data types in corresponding columns must be identical</li>
        <li>B. The column names in the tables must be identical</li>
        <li class="active">C. It combines rows from two queries, regardless of the column names</li>
        <li>D. It combines columns from two queries based on the column index</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When appending queries in Power Query, Power BI stacks the rows from one table on top of another. Matching of columns is based on column names, but even if names differ, the append operation still occurs; unmatched columns will contain nulls where data is missing. Data types do not need to be identical, and it does not combine columns by index.</p>
