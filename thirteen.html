    <h1>Question 121</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You have a column that contains full names in the format "FirstName LastName". You want to create two additional columns for first and last names by writing a single line of code for each in Power Query. Which code allows you to achieve that? Select all that apply.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Text.BeforeDelimiter([FullName], " ")</li>
        <li>B. Text.AfterDelimiter([FullName], " ")</li>
        <li>C. Text.Split([FullName], " ")</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="active">A. Text.BeforeDelimiter([FullName], " ")</li>
        <li class="active">B. Text.AfterDelimiter([FullName], " ")</li>
        <li>C. Text.Split([FullName], " ")</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Text.BeforeDelimiter extracts everything before the space, which gives the first name, and Text.AfterDelimiter extracts everything after the space, which gives the last name. Text.Split returns a list of values, not a single text value, so it cannot directly be used as a one-line expression for a column without further steps.</p>

    <h1>Question 124</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are designing a Power BI report to analyze customer profitability. <br>
You have two datasets: a "CustomerInfo" table containing customer details (CustomerID, CustomerName, Segment, Country) and an "Orders" table with order information (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, ProductID, SalesAmount). <br>
CustomerID in "CustomerInfo" is currenty stored as text, while CustomerID in "Orders" is stored as whole number.
As convention, data engineers in your company stores numerical IDs as whole number. <br>
You need to create the data model and relationships to enable analysis of customer profitability by segment and country.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. A relationship should be created between the CustomerID column in the "CustomerInfo" table and the OrderID column in the "Orders" table.</li>
        <li>B. The "Segment" and "Country" fields used for analyzing customer profitability should come from the "CustomerInfo" table.</li>
        <li>C. The data type of the column "CustomerID in "CustomerInfo" tables must be set to Whole Number.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. A relationship should be created between the CustomerID column in the "CustomerInfo" table and the OrderID column in the "Orders" table.</li>
        <li class="active">B. The "Segment" and "Country" fields used for analyzing customer profitability should come from the "CustomerInfo" table.</li>
        <li class="active">C. The data type of the column "CustomerID in "CustomerInfo" tables must be set to Whole Number.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Segment and Country are descriptive customer attributes, so they must come from the CustomerInfo dimension table to analyze profitability correctly. Also, CustomerID data types must match across tables to create a valid relationship, so converting CustomerInfo.CustomerID to Whole Number is required. Option A is incorrect because relationships should be based on CustomerID, not OrderID.</p>

    <h1>Question 126</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst for a university with several departments (e.g., Mathematics, Biology, Literature). You've created a Power BI report to analyze student performance data, which includes sensitive information like grades and personal details. <br>
To protect student privacy, you've implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) with a role called "Faculty" that allows professors to see data only for students in their own department. You've published the dataset and report to a Power BI workspace accessible to all faculty members. <br>
Now, you need to ensure that professors can only see data for their respective departments when they access the report. <br>
Question: <br>
What should you do to apply the "Faculty" RLS role to the appropriate professors?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. From powerbi.com, add professors to the "Faculty" role for the dataset.</li>
        <li>B. From powerbi.com, share the dataset with all faculty members.</li>
        <li>C. From Power BI Desktop, modify the Row-Level Security settings.</li>
        <li>D. From Power BI Desktop, import a table that contains a list of all faculty members.</li>

    <h1>Question 128</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are a Power BI developer for "Adventure Works Cycles", a company that manufactures and sells bicycles. You've created a data model to analyze sales performance across different regions. Your model includes two tables: <br>
- Regions: This table contains details about the sales regions (RegionID, RegionName, Country). There are five distinct sales regions. <br>
- SalesData: This table contains confidential sales data (SalesID, RegionID, ProductID, SalesAmount, SalesDate). <br>
Regions and SalesDate are related with a cardinality of one-to-many. You need to ensure that sales managers can only view the sales data for their assigned region. For example, the sales manager for the "North America" region should only see sales data related to North America. <br>
What should you implement to achieve this?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Add a slicer to the report that filters the Regions table by RegionName.</li>
        <li>B. Create a row-level security (RLS) role for each region and define the role memberships based on the sales managers.</li>
        <li>C. Create a RegionID parameter that filters the SalesData table.</li>
