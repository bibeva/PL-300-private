    <h1>Question 181</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>In your role as a BI developer, you are enhancing the accessibility of a Power BI report that includes a visual card displaying current fiscal year revenue totals. <br>
It's essential that users who rely on screen readers can access and understand this data as soon as they interact with the card, and the information needs to remain accurate following any updates to the dataset. <br>
How can you best configure the report to meet these accessibility and accuracy requirements?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Transform the card visual into a simple text box.</li>
        <li>B. Integrate the revenue data into the title of the card.</li>
        <li>C. Set a fixed description in the alternative text field of the card.</li>
        <li>D. Utilize conditional formatting in conjunction with a DAX measure to dynamically update the alt text.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>A. Transform the card visual into a simple text box.</li>
        <li>B. Integrate the revenue data into the title of the card.</li>
        <li>C. Set a fixed description in the alternative text field of the card.</li>
        <li class="active">D. Utilize conditional formatting in conjunction with a DAX measure to dynamically update the alt text.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To ensure accessibility for screen reader users while keeping the information accurate as the dataset updates, you should use conditional formatting with a DAX measure to dynamically populate the card’s alternative text. This approach allows the alt text to reflect the current fiscal year revenue automatically. A fixed alt text or embedding values in the title wouldn’t update dynamically, and converting the card to a text box may not provide the same data interactivity or semantic accessibility.</p>

    <h1>Question 182</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst learning about DAX measures in Power BI. You're exploring the concepts of implicit and explicit measures and want to understand the distinctions between them. You're particularly interested in identifying a characteristic that sets implicit measures apart from explicit measures. <br>
Question: Which of the following statements accurately describes a unique characteristic of implicit measures in Power BI that is not present in explicit measures?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Implicit measures are defined using DAX formulas, while explicit measures are created automatically by Power BI.</li>
        <li>B. Implicit measures are calculated in real-time when a report is viewed, while explicit measures are pre-calculated and stored in the data model.</li>
        <li>C. Implicit measures can be used in any visual in a report, while explicit measures are tied to specific visuals.</li>
        <li>D. Implicit measures are automatically generated by Power BI when you drag a field into a visual, while explicit measures are manually defined using DAX.</li>

    <h1>Question 183</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are developing a Power BI report for a retail management system and are working to integrate the data effectively. Your data model includes a "Product Catalog" table, which holds individual product details, and a "Sales Data" table, which records daily sales figures for numerous products sold across various stores. <br>
To analyze the revenue generated by each product, you need to create a relationship between these tables. To ensure efficient report rendering and optimal performance, particularly when adjusting filters and slicing data, which cardinality should you establish for the relationship between the "Product Catalog" and "Sales Data" tables?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. One to One (1:1)</li>
        <li>B. Many to Many (n:n)</li>
        <li>C. Many to One (n:1)</li>
        <li>D. One to Many (1:n)</li>

    <h1>Question 184</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst working for a healthcare organization. You've created a Power BI report that contains sensitive patient data, including medical history and treatment information. You need to ensure that only authorized personnel, such as doctors and nurses, can access the data relevant to their patients. You decide to implement Row-Level Security (RLS) to restrict data access based on user roles. <br>
Challenge: What are the steps involved in setting up RLS for this Power BI report to ensure that doctors and nurses can only see data for their assigned patients? <br>
Arrange the following actions in the correct order to implement RLS effectively: <br>
A. Publish the report to the Power BI service. <br>
B. Define roles (e.g., "Doctor," "Nurse") and their corresponding DAX filter expressions in Power BI Desktop. <br>
C. Assign users (doctors and nurses) to the appropriate roles within the Power BI service. <br>
D. Test the role configurations using the "View as" option in Power BI Desktop to ensure that the RLS rules are working as expected.</p>

    <h1>Question 187</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>In your role as a BI developer, you are tasked with creating a Power BI report that leverages data from an Azure SQL database named "sales_db." The data structure includes several tables, which you've imported as follows: <br>
- Inventory: Contains the complete product catalog. <br>
- Transaction Summary: Contains high-level details about each transaction. <br>
- Transaction Details: Contains detailed line items for each transaction, including product ID, quantity, and price. <br>
Your analysis goals are: <br>
- Visualize transaction volume over time, including total transaction value. <br>
- Break down transactions by product attributes. <br>
The solution must optimize the refresh and interaction speeds of visuals within the report. What is your initial action?
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Use Power Query to merge the 'Transaction Details' query with the 'Inventory' query.</li>
        <li>B. Create a calculated column in the 'Transaction Summary' table to append product categories using a DAX function.</li>
        <li>C. Implement a DAX function to compute the count of transactions per product.</li>
        <li>D. Use Power Query to merge the 'Transaction Summary' and 'Transaction Details' queries.</li>
