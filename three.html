    <h1>Question 21</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are developing a Power BI report to analyze temperature trends. <br>
You need to create a calculated table named "TemperatureRange" that contains a sequence of integer values representing Celsius temperatures from -20 to 40 degrees. <br>
How should you complete the DAX calculation? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. TemperatureRange = GENERATESERIES(-20, 40, 1)</li>
        <li>B. TemperatureRange = GENERATE(20, 1, 40)</li>
        <li>C. TemperatureRange = GENERATEALL(-20, 40, 1)</li>
        <li>D. TemperatureRange = GENERATE(-20, -1, 40)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="active">A. TemperatureRange = GENERATESERIES(-20, 40, 1)</li>
        <li>B. TemperatureRange = GENERATE(20, 1, 40)</li>
        <li>C. TemperatureRange = GENERATEALL(-20, 40, 1)</li>
        <li>D. TemperatureRange = GENERATE(-20, -1, 40)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The GENERATESERIES function creates a single-column table of numeric values, starting from a specified value and ending at another, with a defined increment. Here, it generates integers from -20 to 40, increasing by 1, which is perfect for representing a range of Celsius temperatures.</p>

    <h1>Question 23</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You have a Power BI report that analyzes customer orders. The report imports an "Orders" table with the following date-related columns: <br>
- Order Date <br>
- Shipping Date <br>
- Delivery Date <br>
You also have a "Date" table. You need to analyze order trends over time based on each of these date columns. <br>
Solution: You create three active relationships between the "Date" table and the "Orders" table, one for each date column.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Yes</li>
        <li>B. No</li>

        <li class="active">B. No</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Power BI, only one active relationship can exist between two tables. For multiple date columns, you create one active relationship and define the others as inactive, then use DAX functions like USERELATIONSHIP() to activate the inactive relationships when needed for analysis.</p>

      <p>You have a Power BI report that analyzes customer orders. The report imports an "Orders" table with the following date-related columns: <br>
- Order Date <br>
- Shipping Date <br>
- Delivery Date <br>
You also have a "Date" table. You need to analyze order trends over time based on each of these date columns. <br>
Solution: You create a single active relationship between the "Date" table and the "Orders" table using the "Order Date" column, and two more inactive relationships using Shipping and Delivery Date. You then create measures that use the USERELATIONSHIP DAX function to analyze trends based on "Shipping Date" and "Delivery Date." <br>
Does this meet the goal?</p>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Power BI allows only one active relationship between two tables. By creating inactive relationships for Shipping Date and Delivery Date, and using USERELATIONSHIP() in measures, you can dynamically analyze trends based on any of the date columns, effectively meeting the reporting goal.</p>

      <p>A BI analyst is tasked with integrating real-time sales data from an on-premises MySQL database into Power BI reports. The project utilizes Power BI's Enhanced Compute Engine capabilities to facilitate this integration. <br>
The requirements for the solution include: <br>
- Reducing the load on online transactional processing systems. <br>
- Decreasing the time it takes to calculate and display report visuals. <br>
- Ensuring the report features data up to the end of the previous day for the ongoing year. <br>
What approach should the analyst take to align with these requirements?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Establish a data connection using DirectQuery mode for real-time data access.</li>
        <li>B. Establish a data connection using DirectQuery mode and set up an on-premises data gateway.</li>
        <li>C. Opt for a data connection in Import mode and configure the system for daily refreshes.</li>
        <li>D. Select a data connection in Import mode and implement a Microsoft Power Automate flow for hourly updates.</li>

        <li>A. Establish a data connection using DirectQuery mode for real-time data access.</li>
        <li>B. Establish a data connection using DirectQuery mode and set up an on-premises data gateway.</li>
        <li class="active">C. Opt for a data connection in Import mode and configure the system for daily refreshes.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Using Import mode reduces load on transactional systems and improves visual performance by storing a local copy of the data. Configuring daily refreshes ensures the report reflects data up to the end of the previous day, meeting the requirement for up-to-date analysis without stressing the source system. DirectQuery would increase load and slow down visuals.</p>

        <li>D. a waterfall chart</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A stacked bar chart allows stakeholders to compare values across categories—in this case, customer satisfaction scores across different support channels—while also showing the contribution of subcategories if needed. Line charts show trends over time, 100% stacked bars show relative proportions, and waterfall charts show sequential changes, making them less suitable for this comparison.</p>

    <h1>Question 27</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You're working with a dataset of customer feedback. One column, "Sentiment," classifies feedback as "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral." However, the data source has inconsistencies in capitalization (e.g., "positive," "POSITIVE," "Neutral"). <br>
Your Power BI report uses a DirectQuery connection to this data source. When analyzing the report, you notice incorrect counts and filtering issues related to the "Sentiment" column. <br>
To fix this, you plan to use Power Query Editor to transform the "Sentiment" column, ensuring all values adhere to a consistent capitalization format (e.g., "Positive"). <br>
Will this solution address the inconsistencies and ensure accurate analysis in your Power BI report?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Yes</li>

        <li class="active">B. No</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In DirectQuery mode, transformations applied in Power Query may not always be supported or fully executed on the source, especially text transformations like changing capitalization. Therefore, inconsistencies in the "Sentiment" column may persist. To ensure accurate analysis, the data should be standardized at the source or handled with DAX measures within Power BI.</p>

Your Power BI report uses a DirectQuery connection to this data source. When analyzing the report, you notice incorrect counts and filtering issues related to the "Sentiment" column. <br>
To fix this, you consider implicitly converting the "Sentiment" column values to the required data type. <br>
Will this solution address the inconsistencies and ensure accurate analysis in your Power BI report?</p>

    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Implicitly converting the "Sentiment" column to a data type (e.g., text) does not resolve inconsistencies in capitalization. DirectQuery relies on the source database for query execution, so variations like "positive" vs. "POSITIVE" will still cause incorrect counts and filtering. To fix this, the data must be standardized at the source or handled with DAX transformations in the report.</p>

Your Power BI report uses a DirectQuery connection to this data source. When analyzing the report, you notice incorrect counts and filtering issues related to the "Sentiment" column. <br>
To fix this, the proposed solution is to add an index key to the table and normalize the casing of the "Sentiment" column directly in the data source. <br>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Normalizing the casing of the "Sentiment" column at the source ensures consistent values (e.g., all "Positive") before Power BI queries the data. This eliminates counting and filtering issues in DirectQuery mode. Adding an index key does not affect the inconsistency but can help uniquely identify rows if needed. The key fix is source-level data standardization.</p>

      <p>You are merging two tables in Power Query: <br>
- Sales (with columns: SaleID, ProductID, Date, Amount) <br>
- Products (with columns: ProductID, ProductName, Price) <br>
You want to include all rows from the Sales table and only matching rows from the Products table. Which type of join will you use?</p>

    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A Left Outer Join returns all rows from the left table (Sales) and only the matching rows from the right table (Products). If a SaleID has no corresponding ProductID in Products, the result will still include the sale with null values for Product columns. This ensures no sales data is lost while adding product details where available.</p>
