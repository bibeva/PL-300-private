    <h1>Question 71</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Which visualization in Power BI allows for drilling down into data hierarchies within the same visual?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Pie chart</li>
        <li>B. Scatter</li>
        <li>C. Matrix</li>
        <li>D. Slicer</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Pie chart</li>
        <li>B. Scatter</li>
        <li class="active">C. Matrix</li>
        <li>D. Slicer</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Matrix visual supports expanding and collapsing hierarchical levels directly inside the same visual, allowing true drill-down. Pie charts and scatters don’t handle hierarchies, and slicers only filter data rather than drill into structured levels.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst working for a marketing agency. You have an Excel workbook that contains two sheets: "CampaignA" and "CampaignB." Each sheet lists the names of social media influencers who participated in the respective marketing campaigns. Some influencers participated in both campaigns. <br>
Challenge: You need to create a master list of all influencers who participated in either campaign, ensuring that each influencer appears only once in the list, even if they participated in both campaigns. You want to achieve this using Power Query Editor in Power BI Desktop. <br>
Solution: Which three actions should you perform in sequence to create this master list with no duplicate influencer names? <br>
Available Actions: <br>
A. From Power BI Desktop, import the data from Excel, and select the "CampaignA" and "CampaignB" sheets. <br>
B. From Power Query Editor, merge "CampaignB" into "CampaignA." <br>
C. From Power Query Editor, append "CampaignB" to "CampaignA." <br>
D. From Power Query Editor, select the resulting appended table and then select "Remove Duplicates." <br>
E. From Power Query Editor, group the tables by the "Influencer Name" column. <br>
F. From Power Query Editor, transpose the tables.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. A, C, D</li>
        <li>B. A, F, C</li>
        <li>C. C, F, E</li>
        <li>D. C, B, D</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="active">A. A, C, D</li>
        <li>B. A, F, C</li>
        <li>C. C, F, E</li>
        <li>D. C, B, D</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> You first import both sheets, then append them to stack all influencer names into one table. Since some influencers appear in both campaigns, removing duplicates after the append produces a clean master list. Merging, grouping, or transposing wouldn’t correctly combine the lists for this purpose.</p>

      <p>You are tasked with importing data from a Microsoft Excel document located in a SharePoint Online library into a Power BI dataset. The goal is to enable dataset refreshing within the Power BI service. Which two data source options should you utilize to establish a connection to the document? Each correct choice offers a full solution.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Excel Online (Business)</li>
        <li>B. XML</li>
        <li>C. SharePoint Folder</li>

        <li>D. Web</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Excel files stored in SharePoint Online should be accessed either through Excel Online (Business) or SharePoint Folder, because both connectors are fully supported for scheduled refresh and correctly authenticate against SharePoint Online. Using Web to connect to a SharePoint Excel file often results in refresh failures in the Power BI service because it does not authenticate correctly for protected SharePoint/OneDrive resources.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst working for a customer service department. You have a CSV file that contains customer call logs. This file includes a column named "CallTime" that records the date and time of each call. However, the data in "CallTime" is in a non-standard format: "December 31, 2018, 10:30 AM." <br>
You want to analyze call volumes and trends over time using Power BI's built-in date hierarchy, which allows you to drill down from year to quarter to month to day. <br>
Challenge: The non-standard format of the "CallTime" column prevents you from directly using Power BI's date hierarchy. You need to transform this column to make it compatible with the date hierarchy. <br>
Solution: What should you do in Power Query Editor to transform the "CallTime" column and enable the use of Power BI's built-in date hierarchy for your analysis?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Change the data type of the "CallTime" column to Date/Time.</li>
        <li>B. Apply a transformation to extract only the year from the "CallTime" column.</li>
        <li>C. Split the "CallTime" column into separate columns for date and time using the comma (,) as the delimiter.</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Power Query can automatically interpret formats like “December 31, 2018, 10:30 AM.” Converting the column to Date/Time standardizes it so Power BI can generate the full date hierarchy without needing to split or manually extract parts.</p>

        <li>D. Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "Year", Date.Year([OrderDate]))</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Power Query requires a row-by-row function when creating a custom column, so the each keyword must wrap Date.Year([OrderDate]). This properly extracts the year from the OrderDate column, while the other options use incorrect syntax or unsupported functions.</p>
