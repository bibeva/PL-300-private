    <h1>Question 41</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You're a data analyst working on a project that requires access to a Power BI dataset called "Sales Insights," which is stored in a workspace called "Marketing Data." You have "Build" permission for the "Sales Insights" dataset, allowing you to create reports, but you don't have any permissions for the "Marketing Data" workspace itself. <br>
To analyze the data and build your report, which two actions should you take? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. From the Power BI service, create a dataflow to the dataset using DirectQuery.</li>
        <li>B. From Power BI Desktop, connect to the dataset by selecting "Get data" and choosing the "Power BI datasets" option.</li>
        <li>C. From the Power BI service, create a new report and select the "Sales Insights" dataset as the data source.</li>
        <li>D. From Power BI Desktop, connect to an external data source like a SQL database.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In a Power BI model, you have two tables, Sales and Date, with multiple date columns in the Sales table (e.g., OrderDate, ShipDate). <br>
You need to create a relationship to the Date table that allows for dynamic reporting on both order and ship dates. What is the best approach to model this scenario?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Create two separate Date tables, one for each date type.</li>
        <li>B. Use a single Date table and create inactive relationships, activating them as needed with USERELATIONSHIP in DAX.</li>
        <li>C. Merge the Sales and Date tables into a single table.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Create two separate Date tables, one for each date type.</li>
        <li class="active">B. Use a single Date table and create inactive relationships, activating them as needed with USERELATIONSHIP in DAX.</li>
        <li>C. Merge the Sales and Date tables into a single table.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Power BI, only one active relationship can exist between two tables at a time. By creating inactive relationships between the Date table and other date columns (e.g., ShipDate), you can use the USERELATIONSHIP() function in DAX to dynamically activate the desired relationship for specific calculations, enabling flexible reporting without duplicating the Date table.</p>

      <p>To share a Power BI report with a colleague without granting them editing rights, you should _______</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. publish the report to the web</li>
        <li>B. share a dashboard instead of a report</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Granting view-only access allows your colleague to see and interact with the report without being able to modify it. Publishing to the web makes the report public, sharing a dashboard doesn’t replace report access, and creating a workspace alone doesn’t control individual permissions.</p>

    <h1>Question 47</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst working for a library. You have two CSV files: "Books" and "Authors." The "Books" file contains information about each book, including its title, ISBN, author ID, and genre. The "Authors" file contains details about each author, including their author ID, name, and nationality. You want to create a Power BI report that analyzes book data, including author information. <br>
Challenge: You need to combine the data from these two CSV files into a single Power BI dataset with a table named "BookDetails." This table should include the following columns: <br>
- Title <br>
- ISBN <br>
- Author ID <br>
- Genre <br>
- Author Name <br>
- Author Nationality <br>
Solution: How should you combine the "Books" and "Authors" queries in Power Query Editor, and how should you manage the loading of the "Authors" query to achieve this?
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Combine the queries by performing a: Merge <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Authors query: Delete the query</li>
        <li>B. Combine the queries by performing a: Append <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Authors query: Disable the query load</li>
        <li>C. Combine the queries by performing a: Merge <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Authors query: Disable the query load</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Combine the queries by performing a: Merge <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Authors query: Delete the query</li>
        <li>B. Combine the queries by performing a: Append <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Authors query: Disable the query load</li>
        <li class="active">C. Combine the queries by performing a: Merge <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Authors query: Disable the query load</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To create the BookDetails table, you should merge the "Books" and "Authors" queries based on Author ID. This adds author information (name and nationality) to each book row. The "Authors" query itself doesn’t need to be loaded separately into the model, so you disable its load, keeping the dataset clean and only including the combined table.</p>
