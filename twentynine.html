    <h1>Question 281</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You're analyzing website traffic data with a clustered bar chart in Power BI. The chart shows the number of sessions for each landing page on your website. You want to add a reference line to easily identify which landing pages are performing above the median number of sessions. <br>
Solution: You decide to create a Percentile Line using the "Sessions" measure and set the percentile to 50%. <br>
Will this accurately identify the landing pages above the median number of sessions?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Yes</li>
        <li>B. No</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="active">A. Yes</li>
        <li>B. No</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Setting a Percentile Line to 50% effectively creates a median line because the 50th percentile represents the median of the data. Any bars above this line correspond to landing pages with session counts above the median, accurately meeting the goal.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Power BI Desktop, you can configure how one visual interacts with another using the Visual Interactions feature. The two modes available are Filter, which filters the target visual based on selections in the source visual, and Highlight, which emphasizes related data in the target visual while keeping the rest visible. Options like Drillthrough, Spotlight, and Cross-report linking are different features and do not control visual-to-visual interaction directly.</p>

      <p>Imagine you're a financial analyst for a retail company. You're tasked with automating the generation of customer invoices. These invoices need to be in a PDF format that's easy to read and print, with all data clearly presented in a structured layout. <br>
The invoices should include details like customer information, items purchased, quantities, prices, and total amounts. You're exploring different options within the Power BI ecosystem to achieve this. <br>
Question: What type of Power BI content should you create to generate these customer invoices in PDF format with a clear and structured layout?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. A paginated report.</li>
        <li>B. A Power BI dashboard with a table visual.</li>
        <li>C. A Power BI report with a table visual.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Paginated reports in Power BI are designed for pixel-perfect layouts and structured document-style outputs, making them ideal for generating invoices, receipts, or financial statements. They allow precise control over page formatting, headers, footers, and repeated sections, and can be exported to PDF, Word, or Excel. Standard Power BI reports or dashboards are better suited for interactive visual analysis but cannot guarantee a fixed layout suitable for printing invoices.</p>

    <h1>Question 284</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are the Power BI administrator for a large healthcare organization with multiple clinics. You have a report that displays patient data, and you've implemented a dynamic Row-Level Security (RLS) role called "Clinic Access." This role filters patient data based on the clinic where the user works. <br>
Each doctor should only see data for patients at their assigned clinic. You've published the dataset to the Power BI service, configured RLS role memberships, and shared the report with doctors across all clinics. A doctor from Clinic A contacts you saying they believe they should be seeing patient data from Clinic B as well, as they occasionally work there. You need to verify exactly what data this doctor can currently access in the report. <br>
What should you do?
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Use the "Test as role" option in the Power BI service to view the report as the doctor's user account.</li>
        <li>B. Use the "Test as role" option to view data as the "Clinic Access" role itself.</li>
        <li>C. Ask the doctor to send you screenshots of the report.</li>
        <li>D. Compare the report filters with the intended RLS logic in the dataset.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="active">A. Use the "Test as role" option in the Power BI service to view the report as the doctor's user account.</li>
        <li>B. Use the "Test as role" option to view data as the "Clinic Access" role itself.</li>
        <li>C. Ask the doctor to send you screenshots of the report.</li>
        <li>D. Compare the report filters with the intended RLS logic in the dataset.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To verify exactly what data a specific user can access under dynamic RLS, you need to simulate their view in the Power BI service. The "Test as role" feature allows you to see the report as a specific user, respecting all RLS rules and memberships. Testing only the role itself (option B) shows the filtered data for the role but not for individual users, which is critical when users belong to multiple groups or have exceptions. Asking for screenshots or comparing filters doesn’t reliably confirm the user’s effective data access.</p>

    <h1>Question 285</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>When developing a report in Power BI Desktop that includes various visual elements, you aim to incorporate a visual tool capable of:  <br>
- Applying filters to other visuals within the same report page, <br>
- Enabling users to perform searches for specific values to use as filters for these visuals. <br>
What visualization type best fits these requirements?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Bar Chart</li>
        <li>B. Pie Chart</li>

        <li class="active">D. Slicer</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A slicer in Power BI is a visual specifically designed to filter other visuals on the same report page. It also allows users to search and select specific values from a column, making it ideal for dynamically filtering data across multiple visuals. Other chart types like bar, pie, or line charts can interact with visuals through cross-filtering, but they don’t provide a built-in search or direct filtering interface like a slicer does.</p>

    <h1>Question 286</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You're responsible for a Power BI report that tracks customer orders for an online retailer. The PBIX file is quite large, around 600 MB, and is published to a shared workspace capacity on powerbi.com. The report connects to an imported dataset with a single fact table containing approximately 15 million rows of order data. This dataset is scheduled for refresh three times a day. <br>
The report consists of a single, densely populated page with 12 custom visuals from AppSource and 18 standard Power BI visuals. Users have reported slow loading times and sluggish performance when interacting with the report, especially when applying filters or cross-highlighting. To address these performance concerns, what solution should you recommend?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Replace the AppSource visuals with default Power BI visuals.</li>
        <li>B. Remove unused columns from the tables in the data model.</li>
        <li>C. Switch the data connectivity mode from Import to DirectQuery.</li>
        <li>D. Increase the data refresh frequency to every hour.</li>

        <li>A. Replace the AppSource visuals with default Power BI visuals.</li>
        <li class="active">B. Remove unused columns from the tables in the data model.</li>
        <li>C. Switch the data connectivity mode from Import to DirectQuery.</li>
        <li>D. Increase the data refresh frequency to every hour.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Large datasets with millions of rows and many columns can significantly slow down report performance. Removing unused columns reduces the memory footprint of the dataset, improves query performance, and speeds up visual rendering. While AppSource visuals can sometimes be slower than built-in visuals, the primary performance gain comes from optimizing the data model, not just changing visuals. Switching to DirectQuery or increasing refresh frequency would likely worsen performance rather than improve it.</p>

    <h1>Question 287</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>In Power BI, which Power Query feature should you use to remove rows with missing values in a specific column?
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Group By</li>
        <li>B. Remove Duplicates</li>
        <li>C. Filter off Blank Rows</li>
        <li>D. Replace Errors</li>

      <ul>
        <li>A. Group By</li>
        <li>B. Remove Duplicates</li>
        <li class="active">C. Filter off Blank Rows</li>
        <li>D. Replace Errors</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Power Query, to remove rows where a specific column has missing (null/blank) values, you apply a filter on that column and exclude blank or null values. This efficiently cleans the data without affecting other rows. Features like Group By or Remove Duplicates serve different purposes, and Replace Errors only handles errors, not blanks.</p>

        <li>D. Filter by Column Index</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Power Query, to ensure only specific columns are imported—even if new columns are added at the source—you can either select the columns you need and choose "Remove Other Columns" or use "Choose Columns" to explicitly specify which columns to include. Both methods create a step that restricts the dataset to only the chosen columns. Options like Exclude Unselected Columns or Filter by Column Index are not standard Power Query actions for this purpose.</p>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a star schema, dimensions should be denormalized to optimize query performance and simplify reporting. By merging ItemGroups, ItemTypes, and Inventory into a single dimension table, you create a flat, comprehensive table that contains all relevant attributes for analysis. Simply loading them separately (A) would maintain a normalized structure, which is not ideal for dimensions. Appending (D) is meant for stacking rows, not combining related entities, and loading only Inventory (B) would omit essential descriptive attributes needed for analysis.</p>

  <div class="questionFormat">
    <h1>Question 290</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're designing a visually appealing Power BI report to present sales data. You have a page in your report that contains the following elements: <br>
- Background Image: A shape containing a company logo or a relevant background image. <br>
- Key Metrics: A card visual displaying a key performance indicator (KPI), such as total sales for the current quarter. <br>
- Sales Trend: A line chart showing sales trends over time. <br>
You want the "Key Metrics" card to be prominently displayed on top of the "Background Image" so it's the first thing users notice. <br>
Question: What should you adjust in the Power BI report to ensure that the "Key Metrics" card appears in front of the "Background Image" shape?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Tab order in the Selection pane.</li>
        <li>B. Layer order in the Selection pane.</li>
        <li>C. Maintain layer order in the General visual settings.</li>

        <li>D. Vertical alignment in the Canvas settings.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Power BI, the Selection pane allows you to control the stacking or layer order of visuals on a report page. By adjusting the layer order, you can bring the "Key Metrics" card to the front, ensuring it appears on top of other elements like the background image. Tab order (A) controls keyboard navigation, not visual stacking, while vertical alignment (D) or General settings (C) affect positioning and sizing, not which visual appears in front.</p>
