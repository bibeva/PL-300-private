    <h1>Question 144</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are given the following statement, select whether it is True or False: <br>
"In Power BI, using a bi-directional cross-filter in relationships can always improve report performance by streamlining the filtering process between related tables."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. True</li>
        <li>B. False</li>

        <li class="active">B. False</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While bi-directional cross-filtering allows filters to propagate in both directions between tables, it does not always improve performance. In fact, it can increase model complexity, create ambiguous filter paths, and slow down DAX calculations, especially in large datasets. Bi-directional relationships should be used judiciously, only when necessary for accurate filtering.</p>

    <h1>Question 145</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a marketing manager creating a Power BI dashboard to track the performance of two different marketing campaigns. You have two reports: "Campaign A Performance" and "Campaign B Performance," each with its own distinct color palette to represent different aspects of the campaigns. You want to combine key visuals from both reports into a single dashboard with a professional dark theme. However, you also want to preserve the original colors used in the reports to maintain consistency and visual clarity. <br>
Challenge: <br>
How can you achieve this consistent dark theme for your dashboard while retaining the original colors of the visuals pinned from the two reports? Which action should you perform in the Power BI service to accomplish this?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Enable "Personalize visuals" for the dashboard.</li>
        <li>B. Apply a dark theme to each of the source reports ("Campaign A Performance" and "Campaign B Performance").</li>
        <li>C. Select the dark dashboard theme from the dashboard settings.</li>
        <li>D. Create a custom theme with a dark background and import it into the dashboard.</li>

    <h1>Question 147</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are developing a dataset in Power BI Desktop for analyzing employee performance metrics. The source data includes several columns with dates, such as the start and end dates of projects. For projects that are ongoing, the end date is entered as December 31, 9999, to signify that the project has no current end date. <br>
The Auto date/time feature is currently enabled in Power BI Desktop. For each of the following statements, select it if the statement is true, leave it un-selected if the statement is false.
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. The Auto date/time feature automatically creates hierarchies for Year, Quarter, Month, and Day for date columns in the dataset.</li>
        <li>B. Turning off the Auto date/time feature could lead to a decrease in the overall size of the dataset.</li>
        <li>C. It is possible to customize the start of the automatically generated date hierarchies to align with the fiscal year of the organization.</li>

        <li class="active">A. The Auto date/time feature automatically creates hierarchies for Year, Quarter, Month, and Day for date columns in the dataset.</li>
        <li class="active">B. Turning off the Auto date/time feature could lead to a decrease in the overall size of the dataset.</li>
        <li>C. It is possible to customize the start of the automatically generated date hierarchies to align with the fiscal year of the organization.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Auto date/time feature automatically generates hidden date tables and hierarchies (Year, Quarter, Month, Day) for each date column, which can increase the dataset size. Turning off this feature reduces the number of hidden tables, potentially decreasing dataset size. However, the start of automatically generated date hierarchies cannot be customized to align with a fiscal year; customization requires a separate custom date table.</p>

    <h1>Question 148</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>In your Power BI project, you are managing a data model that includes these transaction tables with specified storage modes: <br>
-TransactionsRetail (Import mode) <br>
-TransactionsWeb (DirectQuery mode) <br>
Additionally, there's a time dimension table named "DimDate" linked to both transaction tables. To optimize query performance across the data model, especially when retrieving combined data from both "DimDate" and the transaction tables, you must decide on an appropriate storage mode for "DimDate". <br>
What storage mode should be applied to "DimDate" to ensure efficient query execution?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. DirectQuery</li>
        <li>B. Dual</li>
        <li>C. Import</li>
        <li>D. Standalone</li>

        <li>D. Standalone</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Setting the DimDate table to Dual storage mode allows it to act as Import when queried with the TransactionsRetail table and as DirectQuery when queried with TransactionsWeb. This optimizes performance by enabling seamless interactions between imported and DirectQuery tables without forcing expensive queries or data movement, ensuring efficient filtering and aggregation across the model.</p>

    <h1>Question 149</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst who has created a Power BI report to track your company's sales performance. The report has three pages: "Overview," "Regional Analysis," and "Product Details." The "Overview" page contains a KPI visual that shows the overall sales for the current quarter. <br>
You want to add a slicer to the report that allows users to filter the data by month, but you don't want this slicer to affect the KPI visual on the "Overview" page, as it should always display the total sales for the quarter. <br>
Challenge: How can you configure the slicer to filter all the visuals in the report except for the KPI visual on the "Overview" page? <br>
Which two actions should you perform to achieve this selective filtering?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Add a report-level filter for the month.</li>
        <li>B. Add the slicer to each page of the report and enable "Sync slicers."</li>
        <li>C. Edit the interactions between the slicer and the KPI visual to disable filtering.</li>
        <li>D. Create a bookmark that captures the unfiltered view of the KPI visual.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Add a report-level filter for the month.</li>
        <li class="active">B. Add the slicer to each page of the report and enable "Sync slicers."</li>
        <li class="active">C. Edit the interactions between the slicer and the KPI visual to disable filtering.</li>
        <li>D. Create a bookmark that captures the unfiltered view of the KPI visual.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To selectively filter visuals, first add the slicer to each page and enable “Sync slicers” so the slicer selection applies consistently across pages. Then, for the KPI visual on the "Overview" page, edit the visual interactions and set the slicer to not filter it. This ensures the KPI always shows total quarterly sales while other visuals respond to the slicer.</p>

      <p>Imagine you're a financial analyst tracking monthly sales data for your company. You want to use Power BI to quickly identify any unusual spikes or dips in sales that might indicate unexpected trends or potential issues. <br>
You know that Power BI has a built-in anomaly detection feature that can automatically detect such anomalies in your data. <br>
Question: To enable the anomaly-detection capability and have Power BI automatically highlight unusual fluctuations in your monthly sales data, which visual and axis configuration should you choose?

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chart Configuration: Select the "Show value as" option</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Power BI’s anomaly detection works with time series data, which requires a line chart with a date field on the axis. This setup allows Power BI to analyze trends over time and automatically identify unusual spikes or dips in monthly sales. Pie charts or treemaps do not support time-based anomaly detection.</p>
