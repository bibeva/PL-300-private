    <h1>Question 221</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You have created a Microsoft Power BI report for a large-scale data analysis project. The PBIX file size is approximately 550 MB, and the report is accessed by multiple users via a shared capacity workspace in Power BI Service (powerbi.com). The report is built on an imported dataset containing a single fact table with 12 million rows, and it refreshes twice a day at 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM. <br>
This report consists of one page that includes 12 custom visuals from AppSource and 15 built-in Power BI visuals. Users report that the report takes a long time to load visuals and is slow to respond to interactions. What solution should you recommend to improve report performance?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Optimize DAX expressions by using row context functions.</li>
        <li>B. Remove any unused columns from tables in the data model.</li>
        <li>C. Replace built-in visuals with custom visuals from AppSource.</li>
        <li>D. Increase the dataset refresh frequency to four times daily.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>A. Optimize DAX expressions by using row context functions.</li>
        <li class="active">B. Remove any unused columns from tables in the data model.</li>
        <li>C. Replace built-in visuals with custom visuals from AppSource.</li>
        <li>D. Increase the dataset refresh frequency to four times daily.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Reducing the dataset size by removing unused columns decreases memory consumption and improves visual rendering and interaction performance. This is especially important for large fact tables with millions of rows. Optimizing DAX can help, but using more AppSource visuals or increasing refresh frequency would not address the performance bottleneck and may worsen it.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <p>You manage a Power BI workspace for your marketing team. The workspace contains six reports and three dashboards. You need to share a campaign performance dashboard and two related reports with the entire sales department, giving them read-only access. <br>
Solution: You publish an app to the entire organization and create separate audiences. In one of these audiences, you only allow displaying the campaign performance dashboard and two related reports. <br>
Does this meet the goal?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Yes</li>

    <div class="question">
      <p>In your Power BI environment, there is a workspace named "AnalyticsHub" containing a dataset "SalesData" and a report "MarketAnalysis." A colleague wishes to develop a new report utilizing "SalesData" and then deploy this report to a different workspace. <br>
Your objective is to enable this while strictly limiting the permissions granted to your colleague. What is the best course of action?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Assign the role of Viewer to your colleague within "AnalyticsHub."</li>
        <li>B. Provide the Build permission specifically for "SalesData" to your colleague.</li>
        <li>C. Directly share the "MarketAnalysis" report with your colleague.</li>
        <li>D. Include your colleague as a Member in "AnalyticsHub."</li>

    <h1>Question 226</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are a business analyst for a subscription-based streaming service. You've been tasked with creating a report that highlights the top 10 movies with the highest churn rate. Churn rate, in this case, refers to the percentage of subscribers who cancel their subscriptions after watching a specific movie. <br>
To achieve this, you decide to use the RANKX DAX function to calculate and rank the movies based on their churn rate. Will this approach effectively identify and display only the top 10 movies with the highest churn rate in your report?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Yes</li>
        <li>B. No</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Yes</li>
        <li class="active">B. No</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The RANKX function can rank movies by churn rate, but it does not automatically filter the dataset to show only the top 10. To display only the top 10 movies, you must combine RANKX with a Top N filter or apply a visual-level filter based on the calculated rank.</p>

      <p>When preparing a Power BI report that requires analysis of employee performance metrics over time, what is the most efficient way to structure your data model?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. By creating a flat table combining all employee details, performance metrics, and time entries</li>
        <li>B. By designing a star schema with separate dimension tables for employees, time, and a fact table for performance metrics</li>
        <li>C. By using a single large fact table with redundant employee and time data for each entry</li>
        <li>D. By enabling DirectQuery mode for real-time performance analysis without structuring the data model</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. By creating a flat table combining all employee details, performance metrics, and time entries</li>
        <li class="active">B. By designing a star schema with separate dimension tables for employees, time, and a fact table for performance metrics</li>

        <li>D. By enabling DirectQuery mode for real-time performance analysis without structuring the data model</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A star schema efficiently organizes data for analytical reporting. Separating dimension tables (e.g., Employees, Time) from the fact table (Performance Metrics) reduces redundancy, improves query performance, and enables faster, more accurate time-based and employee-based analysis compared to flat or denormalized tables.</p>

    <h1>Question 230</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You have a clustered column chart in Power BI that displays a measure called SalesAmount as the value and a field named Salesperson on the axis. The SalesAmount measure represents the sales revenue generated by each salesperson in US dollars. <br>
You need to add a reference line to the chart that indicates which salespeople are above the median sales amount. <br>
Solution: You create a median line using the SalesAmount measure. <br>
Does this solution meet the goal?</p>

        <li class="active">B. No</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Adding a median line based on the SalesAmount measure will display the overall median across all sales, but it does not automatically indicate which salespeople are above the median. To meet the goal, you would need to create a measure that calculates the median per salesperson and then use conditional formatting or a reference line to highlight salespeople exceeding that median.</p>
