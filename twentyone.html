    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you manage a Power BI workspace for your team's sales reports. You want to allow a new team member, Alex, to publish updated versions of the sales reports on the workspace App. <br>
However, you don't want Alex to change the workspace settings, such as adding or removing members or modifying the workspace name. Which role should you assign to Alex in the Power BI service to provide him with the necessary publishing permissions while restricting his ability to alter workspace settings?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Viewer</li>
        <li>B. Contributor</li>
        <li>C. Member</li>
        <li>D. Admin</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Viewer</li>
        <li class="active">B. Contributor</li>
        <li>C. Member</li>
        <li>D. Admin</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Contributor role in a Power BI workspace allows a user to publish and update reports and dashboards without granting access to workspace settings or membership management. This ensures Alex can manage content effectively while preventing changes to the workspace configuration, which would require higher roles like Member or Admin.</p>

    <h1>Question 202</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're developing a Power BI report for a company with a large sales team. The report displays sales performance data for individual sales representatives, including their sales figures, targets, and customer interactions. To protect the confidentiality of this data, you need to implement dynamic Row-Level Security (RLS). This means that each sales representative should only be able to see their own data when they access the report. You have a table called SalesPerformance with the following columns:
SalesRepName <br>
EmailAddress <br>
Region <br>
SalesAmount <br>
TargetAmount <br>
Question: Which DAX expression should you use in your RLS rule to ensure that sales representatives can only see their own data, and this rule works correctly both when testing the report in Power BI Desktop and after publishing it to the Power BI service?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. [EmailAddress] - USERNAME()</li>
        <li>B. [SalesRepName] - USERPRINCIPALNAME()</li>
        <li>C. [SalesRepName] = USERNAME()</li>
        <li>D. [EmailAddress] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. [EmailAddress] - USERNAME()</li>
        <li>B. [SalesRepName] - USERPRINCIPALNAME()</li>
        <li>C. [SalesRepName] = USERNAME()</li>
        <li class="active">D. [EmailAddress] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To implement dynamic RLS in Power BI, you compare a column that uniquely identifies the user, such as EmailAddress, with the USERPRINCIPALNAME() function, which returns the logged-in user's email. This ensures each sales representative sees only their own data both in Power BI Desktop’s “View as” feature and in the Power BI Service after publishing.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <p>You manage a Microsoft Power BI report for your organization. The PBIX file size is substantial at 550 MB, and the report is hosted on a shared capacity on powerbi.com within an App workspace. The report draws from an imported dataset comprising a single fact table with 12 million rows, refreshed bi-daily at 08:00 and 17:00. <br>
The report layout consists of a single page, featuring 15 third-party AppSource visuals and 10 built-in Power BI visuals. Users have reported experiencing delays when loading and interacting with the visuals. To enhance the report’s performance, which of the following actions would you recommend?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Modify DAX measures to utilize iterator functions more extensively.</li>
        <li>B. Activate enhanced visual interaction settings.</li>
        <li>C. Transition from built-in visuals to more third-party AppSource visuals.</li>
        <li>D. Distribute the visuals across several pages.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>A. Modify DAX measures to utilize iterator functions more extensively.</li>
        <li>B. Activate enhanced visual interaction settings.</li>
        <li>C. Transition from built-in visuals to more third-party AppSource visuals.</li>
        <li class="active">D. Distribute the visuals across several pages.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Having too many visuals on a single page, especially a mix of built-in and third-party AppSource visuals, can significantly slow down rendering and interaction. Splitting visuals across multiple pages reduces the number of visuals that need to load simultaneously, improving performance. Using more iterators or third-party visuals typically worsens performance, and enhanced interaction settings do not address the core load issue.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <p>You manage a data source in Azure SQL Database where sales transactions are recorded and updated continuously. You are tasked with creating reports to monitor for potential fraudulent transactions, which requires that the data in your reports reflects changes from the database within five minutes of their occurrence. <br>
What is the most appropriate way to set up the data connection to meet this requirement?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Implement a SQL query to fetch the data.</li>
        <li>B. Configure the 'Command timeout' setting in minutes.</li>
        <li>C. Use the Import data connectivity mode.</li>
        <li>D. Use the DirectQuery data connectivity mode.</li>

        <li>A. Implement a SQL query to fetch the data.</li>
        <li>B. Configure the 'Command timeout' setting in minutes.</li>
        <li>C. Use the Import data connectivity mode.</li>
        <li class="active">D. Use the DirectQuery data connectivity mode.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> DirectQuery enables Power BI reports to query the underlying Azure SQL Database in real time, ensuring that the data reflects changes almost immediately, meeting the five-minute freshness requirement. Import mode, in contrast, loads a static snapshot of the data, which would not provide near-real-time updates.</p>

    <h1>Question 206</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Which is the first (highest) role in Power BI Service which is NOT inherently granted permission to share dashboards?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Viewer</li>
        <li>B. Contributor</li>
        <li>C. Member</li>

        <li>D. Admin</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Power BI Service, the Contributor role can create and edit content in a workspace but cannot share dashboards or reports with others. Sharing permissions start with the Member role, which allows users to distribute content while Admins retain full control over the workspace. Viewers only have read access and cannot edit or share content.</p>

        <li>D. Disabling query folding in Power Query.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Using Import mode loads data into Power BI’s in-memory engine, which speeds up refresh and query performance. Normalizing the data model by splitting large tables reduces data redundancy and improves efficiency. Removing unused columns and rows decreases dataset size, further enhancing refresh times. Disabling query folding is counterproductive, as query folding pushes transformations to the source, improving refresh performance.</p>
