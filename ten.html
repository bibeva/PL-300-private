    <h1>Question 91</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>How does the refresh behavior of Power BI reports change when using a live connection to a database compared to importing data?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Live connection reports require manual refresh to load updated data</li>
        <li>B. Live connection reports automatically reflect updates in the source database without the need for a dataset refresh in Power BI</li>
        <li>C. Live connection reports only update data during scheduled refresh periods set in the Power BI service</li>
        <li>D. Live connection and imported data reports refresh at the same frequency and method</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Live connection reports require manual refresh to load updated data</li>
        <li class="active">B. Live connection reports automatically reflect updates in the source database without the need for a dataset refresh in Power BI</li>
        <li>C. Live connection reports only update data during scheduled refresh periods set in the Power BI service</li>
        <li>D. Live connection and imported data reports refresh at the same frequency and method</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Live connections do not import data into Power BI; instead, they query the source database directly. This means any changes in the source are immediately reflected in the report, unlike imported models that require scheduled or manual refresh.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <p>You are a Power BI developer for a busy e-commerce company. You've created a report to track website traffic and sales conversions. This report is crucial for the marketing team to monitor campaign effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. The report uses an imported dataset containing a single fact table with 15 million rows of web traffic data. <br>
This dataset refreshes every 6 hours to ensure the marketing team has access to near real-time information. The report currently consists of a single, densely packed page with 10 custom visuals from AppSource and 15 standard Power BI visuals. The marketing team has reported that the report is slow to load and becomes unresponsive when interacting with the visuals. <br>
You need to recommend a solution to improve the performance of the report. What should you recommend?</p>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Enabling bidirectional cross-filtering between tables like Sales and Customers allows filters to flow in both directions, which can simplify some calculations. However, it also increases the complexity of the model, as multiple filter paths may exist between tables. This can lead to ambiguous relationships, unexpected results in visuals, and potential performance issues when Power BI tries to resolve which filters to apply. Careful modeling is needed to avoid these complications.</p>

    <h1>Question 97</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst for a large online retailer. You're creating a Power BI report to track sales performance across different product categories and regions. Your data model has two tables: <br>
- Sales: Contains detailed information about each sale, such as the order ID, product ID, customer ID, date, quantity, and revenue. <br>
- Products: Contains information about each product, including product ID, category, cost, and other attributes. <br>
To protect sensitive data, you've implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) on both tables. For example, sales managers might only be able to see sales data for their assigned regions, and product managers might only be able to see data for the product categories they manage. <br>
Now, you need to create a relationship between the Sales and Products tables to analyze sales by product category. However, it's crucial that this relationship respects the RLS rules you've already defined. When you filter by product category, you want to ensure that users only see sales data that they are authorized to access based on their RLS roles. <br>
Question: How should you create the relationship between the Sales and Products tables to ensure that bidirectional cross-filtering works correctly with the existing RLS settings?

        <li>C. Create an inactive relationship between the tables and select "Assume referential integrity."</li>
        <li>D. Create an active relationship between the tables and select "Assume referential integrity."</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Create an inactive relationship between the tables and select "Apply security filter in both directions."</li>
        <li class="active">B. Create an active relationship between the tables and select "Apply security filter in both directions."</li>
        <li>C. Create an inactive relationship between the tables and select "Assume referential integrity."</li>
        <li>D. Create an active relationship between the tables and select "Assume referential integrity."</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To analyze sales by product category while respecting existing RLS rules, the relationship between Sales and Products must be active so that it participates in filtering by default. Enabling "Apply security filter in both directions" ensures that RLS applied on either table (Sales or Products) propagates correctly across the relationship. This allows users to see only the data they are authorized to access while maintaining correct bidirectional filter behavior for reporting and analysis.</p>

        <li>D. List.Times</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The List.Dates function in Power Query M is designed to generate a list of sequential dates given a start date, a count, and a duration interval (typically #duration(1,0,0,0) for daily increments). This makes it ideal for creating a universal date table spanning multiple years, as it automatically produces one row per day, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency in your date dimension.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To optimize a report for a large, vertically oriented screen, you should configure the report page dimensions explicitly in Power BI Desktop’s canvas settings. This allows you to set a custom width and height that match the physical display, ensuring visuals are proportionally arranged and make full use of the screen space. Simply fitting to width or personalizing visuals does not guarantee proper alignment for non-standard screen orientations.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Exclude Remaining Columns feature in Power Query dynamically removes all columns except the ones you explicitly select (in this case, all except "CustomerID"). This ensures that if new columns are added to the source in the future, they are automatically excluded from your dataset during refresh. Simply using Remove Column or Select Columns is static and would not automatically handle new columns added later.</p>
