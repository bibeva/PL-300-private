    <div class="question">
      <p>Scenario: You are tasked with developing a dashboard for a marketing team using the Power BI service. The team has an interactive report page that displays trends in advertising spend, campaign engagement, and conversion rates through three dynamic charts. <br>
Objective: Your goal is to integrate these charts into the dashboard in a manner that preserves the interactivity existing among them, allowing the marketing team to continue analyzing data with the same level of engagement and detail as in the original report. <br>
Question: How should you add the charts from the report page to the dashboard to ensure the interactive capabilities among the charts are retained?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Modify the report's interactions and set all connections to 'Filter'.</li>
        <li>B. Pin each chart individually as a separate tile on the dashboard.</li>
        <li>C. Change the dashboard's theme and then pin each chart as a tile.</li>
        <li>D. Pin the entire report page as a live tile on the dashboard.</li>

    <div class="question">
      <p>Scenario: As a data analyst at a tech startup, you are tasked with integrating real-time analytics from various data sources into Power BI for a comprehensive operational dashboard. One of your primary sources is a Cassandra database, which stores large volumes of rapidly changing data. <br>
Objective: You need to establish a connection between Power BI Desktop and the Cassandra database. Upon checking the Get Data options, you find that there is no direct connector for Cassandra. You must identify an alternative method to connect to this database effectively. <br>
Question: Given the lack of a specific Cassandra database connector in Power BI, which alternative data connector should you use to establish this connection?
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Microsoft SQL Server database</li>
        <li>B. ODBC</li>

    <div class="question">
      <p>You are the Power BI administrator for a marketing agency. You have a report named "Campaign Performance" that tracks the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns. <br>
Due to the sensitive nature of the campaign data, you need to prevent report viewers from exporting any data from the report visuals. Your Power BI tenant currently allows users to export data. What two actions should you take to restrict data export from the "Campaign Performance" report?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. From Power BI Desktop, modify the Report settings.</li>
        <li>B. From Power BI Desktop, modify the Page information settings.</li>
        <li>C. From the Power BI service, modify the workspace permissions.</li>
        <li>D. From the Power BI service, modify the Report settings.</li>

        <li class="active">A. From Power BI Desktop, modify the Report settings.</li>
        <li>B. From Power BI Desktop, modify the Page information settings.</li>
        <li>C. From the Power BI service, modify the workspace permissions.</li>
        <li class="active">D. From the Power BI service, modify the Report settings.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To restrict exporting data from a specific report, you can disable data export at the report level. This can be done either in Power BI Desktop (Report settings → Export data) before publishing, or directly in the Power BI service via the report’s settings. Workspace permissions alone don’t specifically control data export, and page information settings are unrelated.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <p>When comparing Live Connection and DirectQuery in Power BI, which statement accurately describes the capability for data model modifications within Power BI?
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Both Live Connection and DirectQuery allow for extensive data model modifications, including adding new measures and calculated columns within Power BI.</li>
        <li>B. Live Connection allows for full data model modifications in Power BI, whereas DirectQuery does not allow any modifications to the data model.</li>
        <li>C. DirectQuery allows for some data model modifications in Power BI, such as adding calculated columns, while Live Connection does not permit any modifications to the data model.</li>
        <li>D. Neither Live Connection nor DirectQuery allows for any modifications to the data model or adding new elements like calculated columns and measures within Power BI.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Both Live Connection and DirectQuery allow for extensive data model modifications, including adding new measures and calculated columns within Power BI.</li>
        <li>B. Live Connection allows for full data model modifications in Power BI, whereas DirectQuery does not allow any modifications to the data model.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In DirectQuery, the data remains in the source, but Power BI allows limited modeling, including creating calculated columns and measures. In contrast, a Live Connection (to Analysis Services or Power BI datasets) does not permit modifying the underlying data model in Power BI; you can only create reports and visuals based on the existing model.</p>

    <h1>Question 278</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>CompanyB is a consultancy company specializing in supply chain management for major online retailers across North America. CompanyB oversees a supply chain solution that incorporates multiple Azure SQL Server databases, with each retailer allocated a distinct database within an Azure subscription controlled by CompanyB. <br>
The analytics team aims to develop a report in Power BI Desktop to analyze inventory levels and identify potential shortages. Given that each retailer might have unique reporting needs, each analyst is tasked with creating a report tailored to a specific retailer, necessitating access to different databases. <br>
To facilitate the analysts in connecting to the appropriate database, a proposal has been made to: <br>
"Introduce a new parameter within the report to store the database connection strings." <br>
Does this proposal align with the objective?</p>

    <div class="question">
      <p>You're analyzing website traffic data with a clustered bar chart in Power BI. The chart shows the number of sessions for each landing page on your website. <br>
You want to add a reference line to easily identify which landing pages are performing above the median number of sessions. <br>
Solution: You decide to create a constant line and set its value to 0.5. <br>
Will this accurately identify the landing pages above the median number of sessions?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Yes</li>
        <li>B. No</li>

        <li class="active">B. No</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Setting a constant line at 0.5 does not reflect the median of your dataset. To identify landing pages performing above the median, you need to calculate the median value of sessions (either using a measure or Power BI’s built-in median line in the Analytics pane) and then add a reference line at that median value. Only then will you be able to visually distinguish pages above or below the median.</p>

      <p>You're analyzing website traffic data with a clustered bar chart in Power BI. The chart shows the number of sessions for each landing page on your website. You want to add a reference line to easily identify which landing pages are performing above the median number of sessions. <br>
Solution: You decide to create an Average Line using the "Sessions" measure. <br>
Will this accurately identify the landing pages above the median number of sessions?</p>

    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Using an Average Line shows the mean value of sessions, not the median. The mean and median can be very different, especially if your data is skewed (e.g., a few pages have very high traffic). To identify which landing pages are above the median, you must calculate the median value of the "Sessions" measure and add a median line in the Analytics pane.</p>
