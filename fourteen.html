    <h1>Question 131</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>What is the primary characteristic of dual storage mode in Power BI?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. It duplicates data across multiple Power BI reports.</li>
        <li>B. It allows a table to be accessed using both DirectQuery and Import methods.</li>
        <li>C. It requires manual synchronization between DirectQuery and imported data.</li>
        <li>D. It only supports connections to SQL Server databases.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>A. It duplicates data across multiple Power BI reports.</li>
        <li class="active">B. It allows a table to be accessed using both DirectQuery and Import methods.</li>

        <li>D. It only supports connections to SQL Server databases.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Dual storage mode lets a table behave as Import or DirectQuery depending on how it’s queried. This improves performance by using cached (imported) data when possible, while still allowing real-time queries against the source when needed, especially in composite models.</p>

    <h1>Question 132</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>When using Power Query's "Group By" feature to aggregate data in a sales table with a high volume of transactions across multiple years, you need to find the year with the highest total sales. Which "Group By" operation and subsequent action can accurately achieve this?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Group by "Year" with "Sum" of "SalesAmount", then sort the summary table by the summed "SalesAmount" in descending order and keep the top row.</li>
        <li>B. Group by "SaleDate" with "Count" of "SalesAmount", then filter the summary table for the highest count. </li>
        <li>C. Group by "CustomerID" with "Sum" of "SalesAmount", then apply a custom column to calculate the rank of each sum.</li>
        <li>D. Group by "Year" with "Average" of "SalesAmount", then use a conditional column to find the maximum average.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="active">A. Group by "Year" with "Sum" of "SalesAmount", then sort the summary table by the summed "SalesAmount" in descending order and keep the top row.</li>
        <li>B. Group by "SaleDate" with "Count" of "SalesAmount", then filter the summary table for the highest count. </li>
        <li>C. Group by "CustomerID" with "Sum" of "SalesAmount", then apply a custom column to calculate the rank of each sum.</li>
        <li>D. Group by "Year" with "Average" of "SalesAmount", then use a conditional column to find the maximum average.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Grouping by Year and summing SalesAmount correctly aggregates total sales per year. Sorting the result in descending order and keeping the top row directly identifies the year with the highest total sales, which matches the requirement exactly.</p>

    <h1>Question 133</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You're tasked with designing an interactive report for a global sales team. The report has four pages: "Regional Performance," "Product Breakdown," "Customer Insights," and "Individual Sales Targets." Each page includes a slicer for "Region" to filter data. <br>
The sales team wants to maintain the selected region across the first three pages for a consistent analysis. However, "Individual Sales Targets" should remain unaffected by any regional selections made on other pages. How would you achieve this in Power BI?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Remove the "Region" slicer from the first three pages and add "Region" to the page-level filters for each.</li>
        <li>B. Remove the "Region" slicer from the first three pages and add "Region" to the report-level filters.</li>
        <li>C. Synchronize the "Region" slicer across the "Regional Performance," "Product Breakdown," and "Customer Insights" pages.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Remove the "Region" slicer from the first three pages and add "Region" to the page-level filters for each.</li>
        <li>B. Remove the "Region" slicer from the first three pages and add "Region" to the report-level filters.</li>
        <li class="active">C. Synchronize the "Region" slicer across the "Regional Performance," "Product Breakdown," and "Customer Insights" pages.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Using the Sync slicers feature allows the Region selection to persist consistently across the first three pages while explicitly excluding the "Individual Sales Targets" page from synchronization. This ensures shared context where needed without affecting pages that must remain independent, which page-level or report-level filters cannot selectively control.</p>

      <p>In the context of Power BI dataset management, you need to understand who has the authority to grant dataset certification permissions within an organization. At which organizational scope level are these certification permissions typically assigned? Choose the best answer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Data Model level</li>
        <li>B. Tenant level</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Dataset certification permissions are managed at the tenant level because certification is a governance feature that applies across the entire Power BI organization. Only Power BI administrators or users explicitly granted tenant-level permissions can certify datasets, ensuring consistent trust and control over certified content organization-wide.</p>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A histogram is designed to show the distribution of numerical values by grouping ratings into ranges, making it easy to see frequency patterns, spread, and skewness. Pie, line, and stacked column charts are better suited for proportions or trends, not distribution analysis.</p>

      <p>True or False: Creating hierarchies in your Power BI model can improve report performance by reducing the number of relationships needed between tables.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. True</li>
        <li>B. False</li>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Hierarchies only organize fields for easier navigation and drill-down in visuals; they do not change the data model structure or reduce the number of relationships between tables, so they do not improve report performance in that way.</p>
