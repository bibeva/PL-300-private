    <h1>Question 81</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>You are analyzing a dataset sourced from a CSV file that details customer feedback. This file includes a column labeled "Timestamp," which logs the date and time each feedback instance was recorded, formatted as "2021-07-15 at 14:45." <br>
To facilitate analysis by date using Power BI's built-in date hierarchies, what action should you take?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Convert the "Timestamp" column's data type to Date.</li>
        <li>B. Divide the "Timestamp" column into two by using " at " as the delimiter.</li>
        <li>C. Create a conditional column that extracts "2021" if the "Timestamp" starts with "2021," and designate this column as an Integer.</li>
        <li>D. Use the Transform function from the Date transformation tools on the "Timestamp" column.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Convert the "Timestamp" column's data type to Date.</li>
        <li class="active">B. Divide the "Timestamp" column into two by using " at " as the delimiter.</li>
        <li>C. Create a conditional column that extracts "2021" if the "Timestamp" starts with "2021," and designate this column as an Integer.</li>
        <li>D. Use the Transform function from the Date transformation tools on the "Timestamp" column.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The value "2021-07-15 at 14:45" is not a standard date/time format. Power BI cannot convert it directly into a proper Date/Time type until the text " at " is removed. Splitting the column using " at " separates the date from the time, allowing you to convert the date part into a valid Date type and use Power BI’s built-in date hierarchy for analysis.</p>

      <p>Imagine you're a sales manager who wants to monitor key sales metrics on the go using your mobile phone. You have several Power BI reports that track sales performance, but they are not optimized for viewing on a small screen in portrait mode. You need to create a mobile-friendly dashboard that displays the most important metrics clearly and concisely. <br>
Challenge: How should you build this mobile-optimized dashboard using your existing Power BI reports? <br>
Solution: Arrange the following actions in the correct sequence to create a dashboard that is easy to view and navigate on a mobile phone in portrait mode. <br>
Available Actions: <br>
A. From the Power BI service, create a new dashboard and name it "Mobile Sales."<br>
B. Pin visuals and tiles from your existing reports to the "Mobile Sales" dashboard.<br>
C. Open the "Mobile Sales" dashboard in the Power BI service.<br>
D. Create a dedicated mobile layout for each of your existing reports.<br>
E. Edit the "Mobile Sales" dashboard in mobile view to optimize the layout for portrait mode.<br>
F. Rearrange, resize, or remove tiles in the mobile layout to fit the portrait orientation and prioritize key metrics.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. A, B, C, E, F</li>

      <p>Your Power Query script is taking a long time to load data, and you suspect that the performance issue lies with the query steps. Which of the following steps can be optimized to improve performance? (Select all that apply)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Filtering rows early in the query.</li>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Filtering rows early reduces the amount of data processed in later steps, improving performance. Consolidating multiple column-creation steps into one minimizes repeated scans of the dataset. Removing duplicates too early slows performance, and increasing refresh frequency does nothing to optimize query speed.</p>

      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst working for a research organization. You have a folder containing hundreds of CSV files with data from various scientific experiments. Each file has metadata embedded in its properties, such as the experiment date, researcher name, and equipment used. You want to analyze this metadata in Power BI to understand trends and patterns in your research activities, but you don't need the actual experimental data in your report. <br>
Challenge: How can you extract and load only the metadata from these CSV files into Power BI without importing the raw data itself? <br>
Solution: Which three actions should you perform in sequence to achieve this? <br>
Available Actions: <br>
A. From Power BI Desktop, select Get Data, and then select Folder. <br>
B. From Power Query Editor, combine the Binary columns. <br>
C. From Power Query Editor, expand the Content column. <br>
D. From Power Query Editor, remove the Content column. <br>
E. From Power Query Editor, expand the Attributes column. <br>
F. From Power BI Desktop, select Get Data, and then select Text/CSV.</p>

      <p>As a data strategist for an international e-commerce company, you have developed a Power BI dashboard that presents comprehensive insights into the company's online transactions. Your current assignment involves delivering a customized version of this dashboard that exclusively showcases transaction data for a specific region. <br>
Proposed strategy: <br>
Incorporate a query string parameter within the data source URL, specifying both the relevant database table or field along with the specific region of interest. <br>
Will this strategy effectively achieve the specified requirement?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Query string parameters in the report URL can filter visuals, but they cannot filter the underlying data source at the query level. Power BI does not support passing query string parameters into the actual data source connection to restrict imported or DirectQuery data by region. To deliver a region-specific dashboard, you would instead use row-level security (RLS), separate datasets, or region-filtered queries in Power Query.</p>

      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst working for a delivery company. You're creating a Power BI report that tracks delivery routes and performance metrics for drivers. The report will be used by drivers on their mobile devices while they are on the road. You want to enhance the report by incorporating location-based insights, such as displaying nearby delivery locations or visualizing delivery routes on a map. <br>
Challenge: How can you configure your Power BI report to effectively utilize geographical data and display location-based information relevant to each driver's current location when they view the report on their mobile device? <br>
Solutions: Which two actions should you perform to achieve this?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Enable location tracking for the Power BI mobile app.</li>
        <li>B. In the Data Category settings, set the geographic data category for the relevant columns (e.g., city, state, zip code).</li>
        <li>C. Create a hierarchy for columns of the geography data type to enable drill-down functionality in visuals.</li>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong>To display location-based insights in Power BI, you must first categorize your columns correctly as geographic data (e.g., city, state, postal code). Then, using these categorized columns in visuals that support maps (like Map or Filled Map) allows the report to render delivery routes and locations accurately. Enabling location tracking in the mobile app is not necessary for displaying data—it’s only used for capturing user location. Creating hierarchies is optional and mainly aids drill-down functionality, not the display of location-based data.</p>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Using Import storage mode allows Power BI to load data into its in-memory engine, enabling highly efficient compression and faster query performance. This reduces the model size compared to DirectQuery, which maintains external storage and can result in larger metadata overhead. Adjusting filters or slicers under Query reduction options affects user interactions and query frequency but does not directly reduce the data model size.</p>
