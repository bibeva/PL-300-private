    <h1>Question 151</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a sales analyst working for a national retail chain with stores in 20 different cities across the country. You have a Power BI report that displays sales data by city. However, your company recently reorganized its sales territories, grouping cities into four regions: North, South, East, and West. <br>
You want to update your report to analyze sales by region, but your data model currently only contains city-level information, not the new regional groupings. <br>
Challenge: You need to quickly and efficiently incorporate the new regional groupings into your report without modifying the underlying data model or creating new tables. <br>
What's the fastest way to achieve this and enable analysis of sales data by region in your Power BI report?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Create a calculated column in your data model that maps each city to its corresponding region.</li>
        <li>B. Create a new table in your data model that lists the cities and their associated regions.</li>
        <li>C. Create a new group on the city column and manually assign cities to their respective regions.</li>
        <li>D. Use the "Bin" feature to automatically group cities into equally sized regions based on sales performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Create a calculated column in your data model that maps each city to its corresponding region.</li>
        <li>B. Create a new table in your data model that lists the cities and their associated regions.</li>
        <li class="active">C. Create a new group on the city column and manually assign cities to their respective regions.</li>
        <li>D. Use the "Bin" feature to automatically group cities into equally sized regions based on sales performance.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Creating a group on the City column lets you quickly map cities into North, South, East, and West directly in the report without changing the underlying data model or adding new tables. It’s the fastest, report-level solution for redefining categories when the source data doesn’t already contain them.</p>

    <h1>Question 152</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst monitoring website traffic for your company's online store. You have a Power BI report with a line chart that shows daily website visits over the past year. You've enabled anomaly detection on this chart to quickly identify any unusual spikes or dips in traffic. However, even though you know there have been some unusual traffic patterns, the anomaly detection feature isn't highlighting any anomalies. <br>
Challenge: You need to adjust the anomaly detection settings to make it more sensitive and increase the likelihood of identifying those unusual traffic patterns. <br>
Which of the following actions would make the anomaly detection feature more sensitive to fluctuations in your website traffic data?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Increase the "Expected range transparency" setting.</li>
        <li>B. Add a data field to the "Legend" field well.</li>
        <li>C. Increase the "Sensitivity" setting.</li>
        <li>D. Add a data field to the "Secondary values" field well.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A. Increase the "Expected range transparency" setting.</li>
        <li>B. Add a data field to the "Legend" field well.</li>
        <li class="active">C. Increase the "Sensitivity" setting.</li>
        <li>D. Add a data field to the "Secondary values" field well.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Increasing the sensitivity makes Power BI’s anomaly detection more responsive to smaller deviations from the expected pattern, which helps surface unusual spikes or dips that might otherwise be ignored. The other options affect visual appearance or structure, not how anomalies are detected.</p>

      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst working for a telecommunications company. You have a dataset named "CustomerCalls" that contains information about customer calls, including call duration, call type (e.g., local, international), and customer demographics. You want to create a visualization that shows the relationship between call duration and call type, highlighting any clusters of calls that have similar durations and types. This analysis could help you identify patterns in customer behavior and optimize call routing or pricing strategies. <br>

      <p>Imagine you're a sales manager who uses a Power BI dashboard called "Sales Overview" to track your team's performance. This dashboard currently shows key metrics like total sales, sales by region, and top-performing products. You want to add a new tile to the dashboard that displays sales by customer segment, but this information is not currently visualized in the underlying report. <br>
You want to add this new visualization without modifying the existing report structure or adding unnecessary visuals to it. <br>
Challenge: How can you add this new tile to your dashboard without making any changes to the existing report? <br>
Which two actions should you perform to achieve this?

      <p>Imagine you're a data analyst who has created a Power BI report to track your company's marketing campaign performance. The report has three pages: "Campaign Overview," "Channel Performance," and "Regional Analysis." <br>
Each page has a slicer that allows users to filter the data by campaign name. However, you want the slicer on the "Campaign Overview" page to filter only the visuals on that page and the "Regional Analysis" page, but not the visuals on the "Channel Performance" page. <br>
Challenge: How can you configure the slicers to achieve this selective filtering behavior across the report pages?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>A. Edit the interactions of the slicer on the "Campaign Overview" page to disable filtering for the "Channel Performance" page.</li>
        <li>B. Remove the slicer from the "Channel Performance" page.</li>
        <li>C. Sync the slicers on the "Campaign Overview" page and the "Regional Analysis" page.</li>
        <li>D. Create a bookmark that captures the unfiltered view of the "Channel Performance" page.</li>

        <li>A. Edit the interactions of the slicer on the "Campaign Overview" page to disable filtering for the "Channel Performance" page.</li>

        <li class="active">C. Sync the slicers on the "Campaign Overview" page and the "Regional Analysis" page.</li>
        <li>D. Create a bookmark that captures the unfiltered view of the "Channel Performance" page.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> By syncing the slicers only between the “Campaign Overview” and “Regional Analysis” pages, the campaign selection made on the overview page will apply to those two pages while remaining independent from the “Channel Performance” page. Slicer synchronization is the designed way to control cross-page filtering behavior; interactions and bookmarks don’t control filtering across pages.</p>
